# Files with a dot in front

Setup using zsh as shell, tmux for shell mangement, vim for editing.

## ZSH
To customise looks working with oh-my-zsh for shell

## TMUX
Don't need [tmux plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) anymore.
Also powerline stuff always sucks, so sticking with this easy config works well, stole most from [here](https://github.com/zaiste/tmuxified)


## Vim

Space is my leader key.
Use buffers only and therefore some nice things to manage that.
Fuzzy search with ctrlp is nice to navigate faster.

otherwise as minimal as possible.
